It is based on [AdminLte](https://adminlte.io/), the "Best open source admin dashboard & control panel theme. Built on top of Bootstrap" and [Core PHP Admin Panel](https://github.com/chetans9/core-php-admin-panel), a simple Admin Panel written in core PHP that contains an implementation of general features you might need in your website admin panel like: record management (CRUD), secure authentication, pagination, filters.
