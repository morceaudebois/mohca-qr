            <h2> About PHP Dynamic Qr code</h2>
            <p><b>PHP Dynamic Qr code </b> is a script that allows the generation and saving of dynamic and static QR codes. It has clean, responsive and user-friendly design. It is Based on <a href="https://adminlte.io/" target="_blank">AdminLte </a> the <i>"Best open source admin dashboard & control panel theme. Built on top of Bootstrap" </i> and <a href="https://github.com/chetans9/core-php-admin-panel" target="_blank">Core PHP Admin Panel,</a> a simple Admin Pannel written in core PHP that contains an implementation of general features you might need in your website admin panel like: record management (CRUD), secure authentication, pagination, filters.<br><br>
            N.B. A <strong>careful reading</strong> of this documentation is recommended to fully understand how the script works.
            </p>

            <h2> What is a dynamic qr code</h2>
            <p><strong>A Dynamic QR code has a modifiable destination URL.</strong><br> A Short URL is placed into the QR code which then transparently re-directs the user to the intended destination. The destination of a dynamic QR code can be changed at any time and as often as you want â€“ even if your marketing material has already been printed. This will save reprinting costs, effort and enable you to respond to any changes in the campaign as quickly as possible.</p>

            <h2> What is a static qr code</h2>
            <p><strong>A Static QR code has a fixed destination URL.</strong><br> The information encoded in <b>static QR codes are fixed</b>. The destination/data is stored directly in the QR Code graphic (hence QR codes are also getting larger and form a more complex pattern if there is more data to store). Therefore, the stored destination/data cannot be changed. Any typo in an already printed QR code cannot be changed, as with any other printed material. <strong>Through this script you can create 13 different types of static qr code.</strong></p>
            
        <div id="setup">
            <h2> Setup</h2>
            <p>You can choose between local installation (recommended for development) and docker installation (recommended for general use)</p>
            <p><u>Follow these steps to install the script locally:</u></p>
            <ol><strong>
                <li>Clone the project from github</li>
                <li>Use src/ folder as Document Root of your webserver</li>
                <li>Edit config/environment.php with your database credential</li>
                <li>Launch install/setup.php file in your browser </li>
                <p>The script checks the requirements, write permissions on the generated folders and creates a database with sample data</p>
                <li>Finish</li>
                <p>If all went well you will see a summary screen with a login button (username: superadmin, password: superadmin). Alternatively, you will get an error message</p>
            </ol>
            <p><u>Follow these steps to install the script with docker via docker compose (simplest method, recommended):</u></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download docker-compose.yml file from github and edit if you want (recommended)</li>
                <li>docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d</li>
                <li>Open your browser at http://localhost:80 and login with (username: superadmin, password: superadmin) </li>
                <li>Finish</li>
            </ol>
            <p><u>Follow these steps to install the script with docker via locally build image:</u></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clone the project from github</li>
                <li>Clone the database project from github: https://github.com/giandonatoinverso/PHP-Dynamic-Qr-code-db</li>
                <li>Build and run both docker image: docker buildx build -f Dockerfile</li>
                <li>Open your browser at http://localhost:80 and login with (username: superadmin, password: superadmin) </li>

        <div id="upgrade">
            <h2> Upgrade</h2>
            <p>To upgrade the program from version 1.0 to version 2.x and maintain backward compatibility with the QR codes you have already created, files and users, you can follow these steps:</p>
            <ol><strong>
                <li>Clone the project from github</li>
                <li>Edit config/environment.php with your database credential</li>
                <li>Launch upgrade/upgrade.php file in your browser </li>
                <p>The script makes the necessary changes in the database that adapt to the new source code.</p>
                <li>Finish</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="multi-account">
            <h2> Multi account</h2>
            <p>Starting from version 2.x, the functionality that supports the creation and management of QR codes with the support of multiple accounts has been added</p>
            <ol><strong>
                <li>Superadmin accounts can manage all users, all qrcodes created</li>
                <li>Admin accounts can only manage QR codes created by them and "universal" ones, i.e. not associated with any specific account</li>

There is a header with the page title and then the different main content for each page. Finally, each page includes the <b>footer.php</b> file with the required js scripts; some pages have <b>additional js scripts</b> needed

As specified at the beginning, the frontend part of this script is done with <b>AdminLTE</b> (Bootstrap). We therefore recommend reading the official documentation to fully understand the HTML structure.

            <h2> Static Qr code</h2><br>
                <p>The physical creation of a static qr code is managed by a free external provider https://api.qrserver.com/ and previously is managed differently depending on the type</p>

            <div id="dashboard">
                <h2>Dashboard</h2>
                <p>The dashboard is the main page of the script. In this section there is a counter of the total number of qr code in the database, and in particular also the number of dynamic and static ones. There is also a counter regarding the number of <strong>scans of the dynamic qr code</strong>.<br>
                    The script offers 2 examples of dynamic charts created with chart.js
The first shows a weekly report of the number of qr codes created (dynamic and static), the second graph offers an overview of the number of scans of dynamic qr codes.

                <h2>What happens when i scan a dynamic qr code?</h2>
                <p>When a dynamic QR code is scanned, the read.php page opens by default which increases the scan counter and takes care of carrying out the appropriate redirect.

                    You can change the name of this page by remembering to change the constant defined in config.php

                    You can also customize the redirect page and increase the timer

                <div id="extra">
                <h2>EXTRA</h2>
                <p>My script is in constant development and I hope to expand it from time to time with more and more useful features, so stay tuned for the updates.<br> With the first version, in the classes that realize the 2 types of qr code, an additional method not mentioned in the above documentation called <strong>addLogo()</strong> is included.

To add this functionality you need to delete the comment characters inside the class and add the input fields to the forms for the user to upload the logo.

However, this feature is not recommended as it can cause different QR code scanning errors depending on the scanner applications.
